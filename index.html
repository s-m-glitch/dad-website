                <h3>Friends in High Places: The Rise and Fall of CLark Clifford</h3>
                <p>Several times, Mr. Frantz and Mr. McKean refer to Mr. Clifford's story as a Greek tragedy. That's
                    certainly Mr. Clifford's own view, and it is in the interest of Mr. Frantz and Mr. McKean as
                    biographers that their subject be of truly grand proportions. Their fascinating book raises inter
                    alia the best argument against the idea: it can't be a tragedy if the main character was never
                    really a hero -- Nicholas Lemann, The New York Times</p>

                <h3>Tommy the Cork: Washington's Ultimate Insider From Roosevelt to Reagan</h3>
                <p> . . it’s the sign of a good book that the reader wishes there was more of it, and many will have
                    that feeling about Tommy the Cork. McKean has used Corcoran’s own papers, interviews with
                    acquaintances and the vast hordes of New Deal memoirs and histories to compile this fine collection
                    of Corcoran anecdotes. He has performed a public service, collecting a revealing boatload of
                    Washington stories and giving Corcoran his first full biography. – Robert G. Kaiser, The Washington
                    Post Book Review (cover).</p>

                <h3>The Great Decision: Jefferson, Adams, Marshall, and the Battle for the Supreme Court</h3>
                <p>“The Supreme Court case of Marbury v. Madison is the most important key to understanding the
                    separation of power in American government. "The Great Decision” makes the tale come alive. It's
                    filled with intrigue, colorful personalities, and political maneuvers that seem astonishingly
                    relevant to our world today." – Walter Isaacson</p>

                <h3>Suspected of Independence: The Life of Thomas McKean, America's First Power Broker</h3>
                <p>"In this fascinating tale of a long forgotten founder, David McKean reminds us that politics have
                    long been rough and nasty—but that integrity and steadfast faith in the rule of law can, then as
                    now, overcome partisan pettiness and reckless passion. McKean is a gifted writer and historian with
                    a clear-eyed view of the past that is highly relevant to the present." —Evan Thomas, author of Being
                    Nixon</p>

                <h3>Watching Darkness Fall: FDR, His Ambassadors, and the Rise of Adolf Hitler</h3>
                <p>"David McKean’s superbly readable chronicle of FDR and his ambassadors offers new insight on modern
                    history’s greatest tragedy: The rise of Hitler and the Nazis . . . . Watching Darkness Fall is one
                    of those works that by illuminating the shadows makes a familiar story all the more powerful. A must
